ConstraintLayout
================

An interactive system of layout generation.

In this work, i have implemented an interactive system for layout design.
With an initial layout created from binary partition, users can interact with the layout by:
i) move a wall;
ii) swap two rooms;
The system will optimize the layout regarding to the constraints on room space, and most importantly, the efficacy of precast concrete based construction in real world.

This is my first project using OpenGL:)
